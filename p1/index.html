   <h1>Bangladesh</h1>
      <p> 
          Bangladesh is a country located in South Asia. My parents were born and raised there and I also lived there for 3 years. It's a nice country with a lot of great people and lots of culture.<br>  You only have one life so you should live it up to the fullest. If you do end up going there you will have a tremendous time getting to know the people as well as getting new memories that will stick with you forever.

    <h3>Theres a great amount of flora and fauna in this land of the Bengal</h3>
    <p>
        Just about every harmless crickets to scaly reptile exists somewhere in the countryside. The Bengla Tiger remains the apex predator in the heavily dense sundurban region. According to the World Wildlife Fund,<a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/bengal-tiger" target="_blank"> these tigers are officially an endangered species.</a> Because of that, it it is illegal to try to find or hunt them by yourself - not that anyone would try to face <em>a Bengal Tiger</em> by themselves. </p>
